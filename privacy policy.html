				<h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">1.Why you need to create a privacy policy</h2>
              <p id="thick" style=" color:white;">
                 Before we get into how to craft your privacy policy, let’s first get into the why. Here are the top reasons a privacy policy is necessary for ecommerce businesses.
              </p>
			     <h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">2.It builds trust with customers</h2>
              <p id="thick" style=" color:white;">
                  As an ecommerce store, you will undoubtedly be collecting personal information from customers and visitors to your site such as name, age, address, email and credit card details. For obvious reasons, many will want to know that this information is in safe hands, so an accessible privacy policy on the website will demonstrate your commitment to security while helping to build confidence in your website and business.
              </p><br><br><br>
			       <h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">3.You need a privacy policy to use certain apps or services</h2>
      				<p id="thick" style=" color:white;">Not only is a privacy policy critical to ensuring that you gain customer trust and that legal requirements are met, but many third-party apps and services also require it — like Google. In order to access certain services and tools like AdSense, Google Analytics, etc., Google requires that you have an up-to-date, comprehensive privacy policy in place on your website.

According to the Google Analytics terms of use:

“You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies that are used to collect traffic data, and You must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g., an opt-out) that are part of the Service.”
      				</p>
					<h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">4.It gives you legal protection</h2>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:white;">
					  Finally, a privacy policy also serves as protection from potential lawsuits from customers as well as other businesses. If your ecommerce site is sued, you can show that you have in place a publicly stated privacy policy that clearly declares what you do with the sensitive information collected.
				      </p>
					  <h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">5.What your privacy policy should include</h2>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:white;">
					    An effective privacy policy will clearly identify the types of data collected through your store, how and why it’s collected, and how it’s recorded, stored and deleted. But there will also be factors that are unique to your ecommerce store that determine what specific privacy protections you need for your policy.

The details of your policy will depend on things like the way you advertise, the products you sell, who your customers are, how you collect payment information, and how payment processors and other third parties are involved with your site and your data.

For example, Gap.com’s checkout page requires unregistered “guest” shoppers to enter just an email address, but when they get to the checkout page, it requires they disclose a great deal of personally identifiable information.

All of that data is personal data, and should be disclosed in your ecommerce store privacy policy. (As what GAP does in its policy.)

When deciding what to include, start by making a list. While this will be individual to each merchant, there are general guidelines that every policy should follow, most of which are required by law.
            </p>
			<h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">6.Cookie policies</h2>
            <p id="thick" style=" color:white;"><br>
             You should also explain if data may be left on a user’s computer. One example are cookies, which are often used to track the viewing habits of visitors, make it easier for returning customers to log in and remembers what products were added to the shopping cart. If you offer the option of avoiding cookies, inform them of the website features that will not be available to them as a result.</p>
             <p id="thick" style=" color:white;"> A good book is like a good friend; the more you read it, the more interesting it will be. They have always benefit to the reader.
					  </p><br><br>
					  <h2 id="thick" style=" color:white;">7.Who to contact for privacy concerns</h2>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:white;">Your policy should also provide contact information for the people responsible for upholding your privacy procedures. Consider creating a special address for this purpose — e.g., “StudentGist@gmail[dot]com”
