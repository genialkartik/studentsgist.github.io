                  The Student Gist Book Store is a student-to-student Internet marketplace providing college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade college textbooks, participate in auctions, post classified ads, provide teacher evaluations, and buy products for college. The book store will enable students to buy, sell, and trade used textbooks directly to other students, by-passing the university bookstores. By selling textbooks to other students, the seller can receive more money than the bookstore will pay and the buyer can pay less than the bookstore charges. It increases the value of book in terms of money.

      				<p id="thick" style=" color:Black;">Books play a very important role in everyone’s life, especially in a students’ life.  They are our best friends because they inspire us to do great things in life and overcome our failures. We learn a lot of things from them. Books are our best companions as they provide us knowledge unconditionally without asking anything in return.
      				</p>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:Black;">
				      Friendship with good books makes you a good person. In case when there is no one for your help, only these will become your companion in life. Books will always be there for you in your adverse times and bring positive value to our life.<br><br>
					  </p>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:Black;">
					    For students, it is worth saying that:
            </p>
            <p id="thick" style=" color:Black;"><br>
              “A room without books is like a body without a soul.”</p>
             <p id="thick" style=" color:Black;"> A good book is like a good friend; the more you read it, the more interesting it will be. They have always benefit to the reader.
					  </p><br><br>
					  <p id="thick" style=" color:Black;">
                Reading books and novels can also improve our memory, reduce stress, and increase mental power as well as knowledge. They also help us to improve vocabulary, concentration power & make our thinking skills stronger.
                <br><br>Books are considered as a “store of information” using which we can gain information by reading at any time. Reading is something that will always increase knowledge. Whether we study or teach anyone, knowledge goes on increasing with time.
